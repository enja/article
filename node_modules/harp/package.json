  "readme": "# Harp\n\n> zero-configuration web server with built in pre-processing\n\n### What is Harp?\n\nHarp is a static web server that also serves Jade, Markdown, EJS, Less, Stylus, Sass, and CoffeeScript **as** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any configuration. It supports the beloved layout/partial paradigm and it has flexible metadata and global objects for traversing the file system and injecting custom data into templates. Optionally, Harp can also compile your project down to static assets for hosting behind any valid HTTP server.\n\n### Why?\n\nPre-compilers are becoming extremely powerful and shipping front-ends as static assets has many upsides. It's simple, it's easy to maintain, it's low risk, easy to scale, and requires low cognitive overhead. I wanted a lightweight web server that was powerful enough for me to abandon web frameworks for dead simple front-end publishing.\n\n### Features\n\n- easy installation, easy to use\n- fast and lightweight\n- robust (clean urls, intelligent path redirects)\n- built in pre-processing\n- first-class layout and partial support\n- built in LRU caching in production mode\n- can export assets to HTML/CSS/JS\n- does not require a build steps or grunt task\n- fun to use\n\n### Supported Pre-Processors\n\n|                 | Language Superset                                                 | Whitespace Sensitive  \n| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| **HTML**        | [EJS](http://embeddedjs.com/)                                     | [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)\n| **CSS**         | [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), [Sass (SCSS)](http://sass-lang.com/) | [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)\n| **JavaScript**  | (TBD)                                                             | [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)\n\n### Resources\n\n- **Server Documentation** - [harpjs.com/docs/](http://harpjs.com/docs/)\n- **Platform Documentation** - [harp.io/docs](https://harp.io/docs)\n- **Source Code** - [github.com/sintaxi/harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp)\n\n\nAuthored and maintained by [@sintaxi](http://twitter.com/sintaxi). Made for the [@HarpPlatform](http://twitter.com/HarpPlatform).\n\n---\n\n### Installation\n\n    sudo npm install -g harp\n\n### Quick Start\n\nCreating a new harp application is a breeze...\n\n    harp init myproj\n    harp server myproj\n\nYour Harp application is now running at [http://localhost:9000]()\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\nHarp can be used as a library or as a command line utility.\n\n### CLI Usage\n\n    Usage: harp [command] [options]\n\n    Commands:\n\n      init [path]                 initalize new harp application (defaults to current directory)\n      server [path] [options]     start harp server\n      compile [path] [options]    compile project to static assets\n      multihost [path] [options]  start harp server to host directory of harp apps\n\n    Options:\n\n      -h, --help     output usage information\n      -V, --version  output the version number\n\nStart the server in root of your application by running...\n\n    harp server\n\nYou may optionally supply a port to listen on...\n\n    harp server --port 8002\n\nCompile an application from the root of your application by running...\n\n    harp compile\n\nYou may optionally pass in a path to where you want the compiled assets to go...\n\n    harp compile --output /path/to/cordova/project/www\n\n### Lib Usage\n\nYou may also use harp as a node library for compiling or running as a server.\n\nServe up a harp application...\n\n```js\nvar harp = require(\"harp\")\nharp.server(projectPath [,args] [,callback])\n```\n\n**Or** compile harp application\n\n```js\nvar harp = require(\"harp\")\nharp.compile(projectPath [,outputPath] [, callback])\n```\n\n**Or** use as Connect/ExpressJS middleware\n\n```js\nvar express = require(\"express\");\nvar harp = require(\"harp\");\nvar app = express();\n\napp.configure(function(){\n  app.use(express.static(__dirname + \"/public\"));\n  app.use(harp.mount(__dirname + \"/public\"));\n});\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\nIf you find a bug you would like fixed. Open up a [ticket](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp/issues/new) with a detailed description of the bug and the expected behaviour. If you would like to fix the problem yourself please do the following steps.\n\n1. Fork it.\n2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b fix-for-that-thing`)\n3. Commit a failing test (`git commit -am \"adds a failing test to demonstrate that thing\"`)\n3. Commit a fix that makes the test pass (`git commit -am \"fixes that thing\"`)\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin fix-for-that-thing`)\n5. Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp/pulls)\n\nPlease keep your branch up to date by rebasing upstream changes from master.\n\n### New Functionality\n\nIf you wish to add new functionality to harp, please provide [@sintaxi](mailto:brock@sintaxi.com) a harp application that demonstrates deficiency in current design or desired additional behaviour. You may also submit a pull request with the steps above.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2012â€“2014 Chloi Inc.
